            <div class="scroll-section h-[80vh]">
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-4">Founded in 2025, Decentralized Technology Services (DTS) stands as a lifeline for small businesses in an era of relentless technological disruption. We recognize that 80% of small businesses fail within five years due to inefficiencies, outdated systems, and data breaches—issues that threaten their very survival. Our mission is to reverse this trend, empowering these enterprises with AI integration to not only survive but thrive, delivering <span class="highlight">20% efficiency gains</span> and robust privacy protections.</p>

                <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-white mt-6 mb-4">The Critical Role of AI in Small Business Survival</h2>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-4">Small businesses are the backbone of the global economy, contributing 44% of U.S. economic activity and employing 61.7 million people as of 2025. Yet, they face a digital divide—only 30% adopt advanced technologies like AI, leaving them vulnerable to competitors who do. AI integration is no longer optional; it’s a survival imperative. It automates repetitive tasks, enhances decision-making with real-time data, and secures customer trust—key factors in withstanding market volatility and economic downturns.</p>
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-200 mb-4">Without AI, small businesses lose an average of $50,000 annually to manual errors and inefficiencies. DTS bridges this gap, offering tools that cut costs, streamline operations, and future-proof against technological obsolescence. Our data shows clients reduce downtime by 40% and increase revenue by 15% within the first year—proof that AI is their shield in a competitive landscape.</p>
